# CinderVM

High-performance Python runtime extensions

Note: currently the only way to use Cinder is as an [alternative CPython runtime](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder),
which isn't [officially supported](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder#is-this-supported).
This extension is a work-in-progress aimed at extracting parts of Cinder as a pip-installable extension.
