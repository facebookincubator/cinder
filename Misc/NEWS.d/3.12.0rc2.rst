.. section: Security

Fixed an issue where instances of :class:`ssl.SSLSocket` were vulnerable to
a bypass of the TLS handshake and included protections (like certificate
verification) and treating sent unencrypted data as if it were
post-handshake TLS encrypted data.  Security issue reported as
:cve:`2023-40217` by Aapo Oksman. Patch by Gregory P. Smith.

PEP 669 specifies that ``sys.monitoring.register_callback`` will generate an
audit event. Pre-releases of Python 3.12 did not generate the audit event.
This is now fixed.

Fix :meth:`multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock.__setstate__` to properly
initialize :attr:`multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock._is_fork_ctx`. This
fixes a regression when passing a SemLock accross nested processes.

Rename :attr:`multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock.is_fork_ctx` to
:attr:`multiprocessing.synchronize.SemLock._is_fork_ctx` to avoid exposing
it as public API.

Use a ``WeakValueDictionary`` to track the lists containing the modules each
thread is currently importing. This helps avoid a reference leak from
keeping the list around longer than necessary. Weakrefs are used as GC can't
interrupt the cleanup.
